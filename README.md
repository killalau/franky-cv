# Franky Lau's CV

This is a repository for my portfolio website. For live demo please visits [http://was-itsolution.com/cv/franky/](http://was-itsolution.com/cv/franky/).

The website is writen in ES6, built with ReactJs, Flux, Bootstrap and jQuery.

The website is a static page so that you may directly open in browser, or host it in web server like apache or nginx.

## Installation

```
npm install -g webpack
```

```
npm install
```

```
node index.js
```

```
webpack
```

## Preview

Open the `index.html` in browser. If you find problems on it, you may copy the project to a web server like apache or nginx, then try again.
